# Image-classification
A classical computer vision pipeline for TinyImageNet100 using hand‑crafted features, including SIFT/ORB extraction, BoVW or Fisher Vector encoding, PCA, and SVM classification. The project analyses per‑class performance using semantic labels and demonstrates scalable, interpretable feature engineering.
